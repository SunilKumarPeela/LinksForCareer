# 📚 The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)

The **Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)** is a trusted, open-source resource for web developers, offering comprehensive documentation and examples for technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. Originally created for browser documentation, MDN has evolved into the central hub for web standards and best practices, supported by major companies such as Microsoft and Google. It is an invaluable reference for learning syntax, exploring code examples, and understanding core concepts—helping developers build cleaner, more efficient applications. Whether you’re troubleshooting, learning new features, or enhancing your skills

# 🔒 The Common Criteria (CC)

The **Common Criteria (CC)** is an international standard for evaluating the security of IT products and systems, first developed in 1994. It provides a structured framework for assessing whether a product meets specific security requirements. While most modern software does not undergo a formal CC evaluation—because the process can be expensive and time-consuming—teams can still benefit from its guidance to design stronger security requirements.

## 🧭 What’s Inside
- **Part 1** – Introduction & framework overview  
- **Part 2** – Security Functional Requirements (SFRs): a catalog of *“security functions you might require.”*  
- **Part 3** – Assurance Requirements (SARs): criteria for confidence that controls are correctly designed and implemented

> 💡 **Tip:** If you suspect your system needs special security requirements and aren’t sure where to start, browse **Part 2** for ideas. Some terminology is arcane, but there’s a glossary to help.

# 🐞 NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

The **NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD)** is the U.S. government’s public repository of standardized vulnerability information. It builds on the CVE® list by adding analysis and metadata—such as severity scoring, affected products, and weakness classifications—to help teams assess risk and prioritize remediation. Even if you track advisories elsewhere, NVD is a central, authoritative reference for vulnerability research and reporting.

## 🧭 What’s Inside
- **CVE Records** – Standardized entries for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities
- **CVSS Metrics** – Severity scores with vector details for impact/exploitability analysis
- **CWE Mapping** – Underlying weakness classifications to guide secure fixes
- **CPE Matching** – Structured identifiers for affected vendors/products/versions
- **References & Patches** – Links to advisories, exploits, and remediation guidance
- **Feeds & API** – JSON data feeds and endpoints for automation and dashboards

> 💡 **Tip:** Start with a **CVE ID**, review the **CVSS vector** to understand risk, then use **CPE** filters to verify whether your exact product/version is affected. Map to **CWE** to inform secure coding and long-term mitigations.
