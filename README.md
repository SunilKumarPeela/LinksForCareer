# 🔒 The Common Criteria (CC)

The **Common Criteria (CC)** is an international standard for evaluating the security of IT products and systems, first developed in 1994. It provides a structured framework for assessing whether a product meets specific security requirements. While most modern software does not undergo a formal CC evaluation—because the process can be expensive and time-consuming—teams can still benefit from its guidance to design stronger security requirements.

## 🧭 What’s Inside
- **Part 1** – Introduction & framework overview  
- **Part 2** – Security Functional Requirements (SFRs): a catalog of *“security functions you might require.”*  
- **Part 3** – Assurance Requirements (SARs): criteria for confidence that controls are correctly designed and implemented

> 💡 **Tip:** If you suspect your system needs special security requirements and aren’t sure where to start, browse **Part 2** for ideas. Some terminology is arcane, but there’s a glossary to help.
